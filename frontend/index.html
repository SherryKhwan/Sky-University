                        Assalam-o-Alaikum! <br>
                        It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to our website. Over the years, we have built a
                        tradition
                        of
                        excellence at Sky University. We take pride in being an institute where every student
                        can
                        find
                        an avenue for success and in being a community where everyone in the SU family strives to find
                        the
                        best
                        in themselves and others. <br>

                        <br>I strongly believe that we all have to be on the same page; students, teachers and parents
                        have
                        to
                        understand that education is not restricted to the lessons and subjects taught in the
                        classrooms. It
                        is
                        beyond the barriers of a room. Parents and teachers must encourage students to ask as many
                        questions
                        as
                        they comes into their minds for nonstop learning.
                        The thirst of knowledge should never be stopped, teachers and parents must keep their learning
                        continue
                        by reading and getting information by keeping an eye on the needs of the student. And must
                        motivate
                        students to develop these habits become a lifelong learner. <br>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="words" data-aos="fade-up">
                <br>Our strong core academic programs as well as outstanding elective programs help the students in
                visualizing their future. We have strong academic interventions to help, council and support our
                students in achieving their objectives. In addition to our highly competitive academic programs, our
                co-curricular activities including athletics and performing arts program, are second to none. We are
                proud to be a comprehensive learning system where every student has an opportunity to pursue his
                area
                of interest and excel in it. We have a kind, caring, highly-qualified staff who truly believes that
                each
                of our students can and will succeed.
                Beyond the classroom, SU offers its students many opportunities to reach the highest level of
                attainment and performance. Our students regularly participates in wide range of competitive and
                recreational sports events.
                Creativity and imagination make children grow up to be dynamic adults who then arrive as citizens of
                the
                world prepared to make their own great impact to mankind. <br>
                <br>“Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited we all now know and
                understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and
                understand.” – Albert Einstein <br>
                I once again welcome you and encourage you to explore the website and discover more about
                Sky University.
